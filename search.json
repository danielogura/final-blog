    "text": "Introduction Section\n\nProject Overview\nThis project delves into how the themes of democracy and governance have been discussed in political speeches over the past century. By analyzing speeches from various political figures, we aim to understand the shifts and trends in how these crucial topics have been addressed over time. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we’ll uncover patterns and significant changes in the discourse on democracy and governance.\n\n\nResearch Question\nHow have discussions about democracy and governance evolved in political speeches over the past hundred years?\n\n\nMotivation\nUnderstanding how political rhetoric changes over time can give us valuable insights into the priorities and values of society. By focusing on democracy and governance, we hope to reveal how political leaders have talked about these important issues in their public speeches. This can help us understand broader social and political trends and shed light on today’s political conversations.\n\n\nRelated Work\nPrevious studies have looked at political speeches to understand rhetoric and sentiment. For example, researchers have used text mining to analyze the language of U.S. Presidents and other political figures, identifying key themes and changes over time. This project builds on that work, focusing specifically on democracy and governance and using a rich dataset of speeches.\n\n\nDataset\nThe main dataset for this project includes political speeches from various sources, such as the Miller Center’s collection of presidential speeches and the American Rhetoric website. These sources provide a wealth of text data spanning many decades and political contexts.\n\n\nData Sources\n\nMiller Center (Presidential Speeches)\nPolitical Speech Archive\n\n\n## Data

    "text": "Discussion\nThe dataset consists of U.S. presidential speeches with metadata, including the date, speaker, and text of each speech. The data was collected from an external source and imported into a pandas DataFrame. The initial visualizations offer a comprehensive overview of the dataset, shedding light on various dimensions of U.S. presidential rhetoric. The distribution of speeches over time reveals significant fluctuations in the frequency of presidential addresses, highlighting periods of heightened political activity or crisis. For instance, spikes in the number of speeches could correspond to wartime efforts, significant legislative changes, or national emergencies. These temporal patterns provide crucial context for understanding the sociopolitical climate in which these speeches were delivered. The word cloud visualization elucidates the predominant themes and recurring motifs in presidential discourse. By focusing on the most frequently used terms, we can infer the priorities and focal points of presidential administrations. Terms such as “freedom,” “nation,” “people,” and “government” often dominate, underscoring the foundational values and concerns consistently addressed by U.S. presidents. This visualization serves as a gateway into the thematic landscape of presidential rhetoric, enabling a high-level synthesis of key issues over time.The analysis of the frequency of speeches by each president offers insights into the communication strategies and styles of different administrations. Presidents who have delivered a higher number of speeches may be seen as more communicative or responsive to the public and media. This frequency can reflect a president’s approach to governance, public engagement, and crisis management. For example, presidents during times of war or significant policy shifts may engage more frequently with the public to garner support and explain their actions.\nThe detailed analysis of democracy and governance within presidential speeches provides a nuanced understanding of how these concepts have been framed and discussed over time. By examining the frequency and context of related keywords, we can trace the evolution of political discourse and highlight the shifting priorities of various administrations. This analysis uncovers how the language of democracy and governance has transformed, reflecting broader sociopolitical changes and challenges.The frequency analysis of democracy-related keywords reveals the varying emphasis placed on democratic principles across different presidencies. Periods with higher frequency of terms such as “democracy,” “freedom,” “rights,” and “justice” often correspond to pivotal moments in American history, such as during the Civil Rights Movement, the Cold War, or post-9/11. These temporal trends provide critical insights into how presidents have navigated and responded to both domestic and international pressures to uphold democratic values. Sentiment analysis further enriches our understanding by revealing the emotional tone associated with discussions on democracy and governance. This aspect of analysis highlights whether presidents have framed these topics in a positive, negative, or neutral light. For instance, a positive sentiment may be prevalent during periods of democratic expansion or significant policy achievements, while negative sentiment might surface during times of crisis or political turmoil. This emotional dimension helps us grasp the rhetorical strategies employed by presidents to influence public opinion and reinforce their political agendas. Topic modeling, as an advanced natural language processing technique, identifies key themes and subtopics within the broader discourse on democracy and governance. By clustering related terms and phrases, topic modeling uncovers underlying patterns and thematic shifts across different time periods. For example, earlier periods might emphasize foundational democratic principles and constitutional debates, while later periods could focus more on global democracy promotion and governance challenges in the digital age. This thematic analysis offers a deeper dive into the complexities of presidential rhetoric, highlighting how focus areas have evolved in response to changing national and global landscapes."

    "text": "The Big Picture\nThe big picture emerging from this analysis is a dynamic landscape of presidential communication that mirrors the evolving challenges and aspirations of the United States. Presidents adapt their rhetoric to address contemporary issues, from early constitutional debates to modern digital governance and international democracy efforts.The discourse on democracy and governance is not static; it responds to the nation’s internal and external pressures, ideological shifts, and the personal styles of individual presidents. Despite variations in tone and focus, there is a consistent reinforcement of core democratic principles such as freedom, justice, and equality."

    "text": "Why is this important?\nThe findings from this analysis hold significant value across multiple domains. For historians and political scientists, tracking the evolution of presidential rhetoric provides a profound understanding of how national identity and policy have been articulated and shaped by various leaders. This historical insight is crucial for comprehending the nation’s core values and reactions to pivotal events. Moreover, the analysis enhances public awareness by demonstrating how presidential communication mirrors and molds national sentiment, especially during critical times. For policymakers and political strategists, identifying rhetorical trends is instrumental in crafting messages that resonate with contemporary audiences and address pressing issues effectively. Recognizing these patterns allows for more informed and impactful communication strategies. Academics in fields like digital humanities, political science, and history can leverage this data-driven approach to formulate new research questions and derive evidence-based conclusions, pushing the boundaries of traditional scholarship. Additionally, educators can utilize these insights to teach students about the interplay between political rhetoric and historical events, fostering a deeper critical understanding of leadership and communication. This educational application not only enriches curriculum content but also encourages students to think critically about how rhetoric shapes public perception and policy."
